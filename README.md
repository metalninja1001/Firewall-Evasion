# Firewall-Evasion
This is a simple demonstration of how to bypass a firewall. It makes use of a server and client script to initiate the connection. 

By executing the server.py script, we start the listener on the host and/or attacker machine.

Next, we run the client.py script on the victim and/or client machine. (You can get creative with this one.)

After you run the client.py script, you should see the below on the listening host:
